Key To My Parameters

WeatherStaions
	This is a list of length 1-3
	The items this list can contain are:
		"canberra"
		"sydney"
		"queanbeyan"
	So, just open the relevant files
	
WetOrDry[0]
	This is a String
	It can either be:
		"wet"
		"dry"
	So this basically dictates whether your function is looking for high or low values

int(DifferenceValue[0])
	This is an int (if that wasn't obvious :'')
	It basically defines the FREQUENCY,
	however.....since a number alone isn't very descriptive I also made...
	
DifferenceUnit[0]
	Which is a String for the FREQUENCY value.
	The units can be:
		"days"
		"months"
		"years"

TimePeriod
	This is a list, which holds info for AGGREGATION.
	The first element (TimePeriod[0]) is a String, which can either be:
		"month"
		"year"
	There may or may not be second element.
	If there is one, it holds info on which month to AGGREGATE with.
	So this item (TimePeriod[1]) is a number between:
		1 and 12

Occurences[0]
	This is a String.
	The purpose of this parameter is for the user to define their own precision in the output.
	So the possible values this String can be are:
		"dates"
		"months"
		"years"
	The examples only gave "dates" and "years"...which implies for formatting either:
		dd/mm/yyyy
		yyyy
	But I thought to add the month parameter just in case...which will output
		mm/yyyy

GO TO LINE 48
	Go to line 48, and there should be the function "runMiles"
	atm, I docstring-ed a bunch of code.
	I'd like you to when testing, un-docstring it.
	Then go to line 56 and 57 which should read:
			Miles1 = miles1(a, b, c, d, e, f)
			Miles2 = miles2(a, b, c, d, e, f)
	I want you to replace that with
			Miles1 = MILES_PYTHON_FILE.METHOD_A_NAME(a, b, c, d, e, f)
			Miles2 = MILES_PYTHON_FILE.METHOD_B_NAME(a, b, c, d, e, f)
	Then add somewhere really early in my file
		import MILES_PYTHON_FILE
	ALSO
		"runMiles" runs on the assumption that your methods A and B return a list of a lists.
		specifically, a list of [DATE, RAINFALL]
			where DATE is a String
			RAINFALL is a Float
